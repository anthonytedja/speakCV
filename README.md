### :speech_balloon: The Motive

Throughout our zoom university journey, our team has noticed that we often forget to unmute our mics when we talk, or forget to mute it when we don't want others to listen in. To combat this problem, we created a desktom client SPEAKCV, that uses computer vision to understand when you are talking and will automatically mute and unmute your mic for you.

### :hammer: The Process

The design began with @anthonytedja developing the web page with bootstrap after discussing how our software will operate with the other developers.
